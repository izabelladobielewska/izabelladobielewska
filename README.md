# Hello there, welcome to Izabella's repository. 

   I am a lecturer at the **Univeristy of the Arts** in Bremen  🎓 and an **editorial desiger.** 
### I'm your person, if:

+ you would like to publish a magazine or a book, 

+ you _for some reason_ would like to learn about [phenomenology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology) or [new materialisms](https://newmaterialism.eu), 

* want to have fun in Tatra mountains and need some tips :sunglasses:
